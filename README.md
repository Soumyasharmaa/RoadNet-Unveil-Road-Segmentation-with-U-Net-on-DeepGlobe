## About the Dataset

In disaster-prone regions, particularly in developing countries, the availability of maps and accessibility information is paramount for efficient crisis response. The DeepGlobe Road Extraction Challenge addresses this need by presenting the task of automatically extracting road and street networks from satellite imagery.

### Data Overview

- **Training Data**: The dataset for the Road Challenge comprises 6,226 satellite images in RGB format, each with a size of 1024x1024 pixels.
- **Pixel Resolution**: These images feature a pixel resolution of 50cm, collected using DigitalGlobe's high-resolution satellite technology.

This dataset serves as a critical resource for training and evaluating road segmentation models, enabling the development of solutions that can aid disaster response efforts.
